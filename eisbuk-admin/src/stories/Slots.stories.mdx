# Slots for bookings

Slots are the basic unit that can be booked.

They have a point in time and some metadata.

This is their primary representation. Clients send this kind of serialisation to the `slots` collection.

```javascript
slots = {
  foo: {
    category: "agonismo",
    type: "ice",
    date: { seconds: 1609513200 },
    durations: [60],
  },
  bar: {
    date: { seconds: 1609495200 },
    category: "preagonismo",
    type: "off-ice",
    durations: [90, 120],
  },
  baz: {
    date: { seconds: 1609516800 },
    category: "agonismo",
    type: "off-ice",
    durations: [60, 90, 120],
  },
};
```

Their ids in the database MUST be uuid4 to avoid collisions. In these examples they are readable strings for clarity.

When a slot is saved a server function is triggered that mirrors the slot contents in a `slotsByMonth` collection.

`slotsByMonth` is organized like this:

```javascript
slotsByMonth = {
  "2021-01": {
    "2021-01-15": {
      ...slots,
    },
    "2021-01-16": {}, // There can be empty days
  },
};
```
